      "No. Everything happens in your browser and your agent. Nothing else to install, nothing else to learn.",

    answer:
      "A small video project on your machine, plus the pieces your video uses. Your agent sets it up. Nothing runs on our servers and nothing phones home.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I change things after it's built?",
    answer:
      "Yes, by saying what to change. The preview updates while you watch, so you react to the video instead of guessing at settings.",

      "MIT. Everything copies onto your machine and it's yours — no account, no runtime, no lock-in.",

      "An afternoon while you get the hang of it. After that, under an hour.",
